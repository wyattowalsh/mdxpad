## Executive Summary

The 007-mdx-content-outline spec has several terminology inconsistencies and missing glossary terms when compared against the canonical sources (Constitution glossary, and previous specs 003-preview-pane and 006-application-shell). Key issues include undefined terms, potential synonym conflicts, and missing alignment with established project vocabulary.

## Findings

### 1. "Outline Item" vs "OutlineItem" Entity Inconsistency

- **Category**: Terminology
- **Status**: Partial
- **Location**: Glossary (line 260) vs Key Entities (line 182)
- **Issue**: The glossary defines "Outline Item" (two words) while the Key Entities section uses "OutlineItem" (PascalCase, one word). This creates ambiguity about the canonical form.
- **Question Candidate**: Should the canonical term be "Outline Item" (human-readable glossary form) or "OutlineItem" (code entity form)? Should both forms be documented explicitly?
- **Impact Score**: 2
- **Recommendation**: Align glossary term with Key Entity naming. Use "OutlineItem" consistently, with glossary entry clarifying it as "**OutlineItem** (Outline Item in prose)"

---

### 2. "Source Position" vs "line/column" Terminology

- **Category**: Terminology
- **Status**: Partial
- **Location**: Glossary (line 261), FR-032 (line 176)
- **Issue**: The glossary defines "Source Position" as "line and column number" but the spec uses "line" and "column" separately in various places without referencing "Source Position". Spec 003 (Preview Pane) uses "position information" in FR-006. Spec 006 uses "cursor position" (different concept).
- **Question Candidate**: Is "Source Position" the canonical term for line/column tuples in the codebase, or should each spec define its own terminology?
- **Impact Score**: 3
- **Recommendation**: Add "Source Position" to project-wide glossary (Constitution) and reference it consistently. Distinguish from "Cursor Position" (006) which is editor-specific.

---

### 3. "AST" Term Undefined in Constitution

- **Category**: Terminology
- **Status**: Missing (from Constitution)
- **Location**: Glossary (line 259), FR-029-032 (lines 173-176)
- **Issue**: "AST" is defined in the 007 spec glossary but not in the Constitution's master glossary. This is a core concept referenced in multiple specs (003-preview-pane mentions "MDX compilation" which produces AST, 007 extensively uses AST).
- **Question Candidate**: Should "AST" be elevated to the Constitution glossary as a project-wide canonical term?
- **Impact Score**: 4
- **Recommendation**: Add "AST" (Abstract Syntax Tree) to Constitution glossary since it's fundamental to MDX compilation and preview architecture.

---

### 4. "Tree View" vs "Hierarchical Tree" vs "Headings Tree"

- **Category**: Terminology
- **Status**: Partial
- **Location**: Glossary (line 262), FR-007 (line 137), User Story 1 (line 27)
- **Issue**: Multiple terms are used for tree-based UI concepts:
  - "Tree View" (glossary)
  - "hierarchical tree structure" (FR-007)
  - "Headings tree" (FR-006 section header)
  - "navigable tree view" (Executive Summary)
- **Question Candidate**: What is the canonical term for tree-based hierarchical UI components? Should "Tree View" encompass all uses, or should more specific terms (Headings Tree, Component List) be documented?
- **Impact Score**: 2
- **Recommendation**: Standardize on "Tree View" as the UI pattern term. Use "Headings Tree", "Component List", and "Frontmatter Section" as specific instances.

---

### 5. "Preview AST" vs "MDX AST" vs "AST"

- **Category**: Terminology
- **Status**: Partial
- **Location**: FR-029 (line 173), Assumptions (line 229)
- **Issue**: The spec uses both "preview AST" and "AST" without clarifying if these are the same thing. Spec 003 doesn't use the term "AST" explicitly but refers to "compiled MDX" and "CompileResult".
- **Question Candidate**: Is "preview AST" specifically the AST generated by the preview pane (spec 003), or is it a general MDX AST? Should we use "CompileResult" (from 003) as the canonical term?
- **Impact Score**: 3
- **Recommendation**: Clarify that "AST" in 007 refers to the parsed structure from MDX compilation (which spec 003 calls "CompileResult"). Consider aligning terminology.

---

### 6. Missing "useErrorNavigation" Definition

- **Category**: Terminology
- **Status**: Missing
- **Location**: FR-023 (line 161), Assumptions (line 232)
- **Issue**: The spec references "useErrorNavigation hook" as an existing pattern but doesn't define it in the glossary. This appears to be a hook from spec 006 (Application Shell) but spec 006 doesn't define it in its glossary either.
- **Question Candidate**: Should "useErrorNavigation" be added to the glossary with a definition? What spec owns this pattern?
- **Impact Score**: 3
- **Recommendation**: Add "useErrorNavigation" to glossary: "A React hook providing cursor positioning and navigation functionality for jumping to specific lines in the editor."

---

### 7. "Outline" vs "Navigator" Title Ambiguity

- **Category**: Terminology
- **Status**: Partial
- **Location**: Title (line 1), throughout spec
- **Issue**: The spec title is "MDX Content Outline/Navigator" (with slash) but the body uses only "outline" (~50 occurrences) and never "navigator". This creates ambiguity about whether these are synonyms or distinct concepts.
- **Question Candidate**: Is "Navigator" an alias for "Outline" or does it represent a different aspect of the feature? Should one term be deprecated?
- **Impact Score**: 2
- **Recommendation**: Standardize on "Outline" as the canonical term. Add to glossary: "**Outline** (also: Navigator): A panel displaying document structure for navigation."

---

### 8. "Panel" vs "Pane" Terminology

- **Category**: Terminology
- **Status**: Partial
- **Location**: Throughout spec, comparison with 006-application-shell
- **Issue**: Spec 007 uses "panel" (outline panel, ~20 occurrences) while spec 006 uses "pane" (preview pane, editor pane). Spec 003 also uses "pane" (Preview Pane). This inconsistency could confuse developers.
- **Question Candidate**: Are "panel" and "pane" interchangeable, or should there be a distinction (e.g., pane for main content areas, panel for auxiliary sidebars)?
- **Impact Score**: 3
- **Recommendation**: Establish convention: "pane" for main editing areas (editor pane, preview pane), "panel" for auxiliary/sidebar UI (outline panel, status panel). Document in Constitution glossary.

---

### 9. "Collapsible" Definition Missing

- **Category**: Terminology
- **Status**: Missing
- **Location**: FR-001 (line 127), FR-025-027 (lines 165-168)
- **Issue**: The spec uses "collapsible" extensively but doesn't define it. There are two distinct collapse behaviors:
  1. Entire outline panel can collapse/hide (FR-001, FR-002)
  2. Individual sections within the outline can collapse (FR-025-027)
- **Question Candidate**: Should "collapsible" be defined to distinguish panel-level collapse (hide/show) from section-level collapse (expand/contract)?
- **Impact Score**: 2
- **Recommendation**: Add glossary entry: "**Collapse**: (1) For panels: hiding the panel entirely. (2) For sections: contracting to show only the header."

---

### 10. "Section" Overloaded Term

- **Category**: Terminology
- **Status**: Partial
- **Location**: OutlineSection entity (line 184), FR-025 (line 165), User Stories
- **Issue**: "Section" is used for both:
  1. OutlineSection (Headings, Components, Frontmatter groupings in the outline)
  2. Document sections (referenced in User Story 1: "jump to a specific section")
- **Question Candidate**: Should "OutlineSection" be the canonical term for outline groupings to distinguish from document sections?
- **Impact Score**: 2
- **Recommendation**: Use "OutlineSection" in technical contexts, "section" (lowercase) for document sections. Add clarity in glossary.

---

### 11. "Click-to-Navigate" vs "Navigation" Terminology

- **Category**: Terminology
- **Status**: Clear
- **Location**: Input description (line 6), FR-020-024 (lines 158-163)
- **Issue**: Minor - "click-to-navigate" in the input description is a compound term that could be documented.
- **Question Candidate**: N/A
- **Impact Score**: 1
- **Recommendation**: No action needed. "Navigation" is sufficiently clear in context.

---

### 12. "Real-time" vs "Live" Usage

- **Category**: Terminology
- **Status**: Clear
- **Location**: Title, User Story 1 (line 38)
- **Issue**: Both "real-time" and "live" are used (e.g., "live document outline", "updates in real-time"). This is consistent with spec 003 which uses "live preview".
- **Question Candidate**: N/A
- **Impact Score**: 1
- **Recommendation**: No action needed. Both terms are industry-standard synonyms for immediate updates.

## Recommended Clarification Questions (Priority Order)

1. **(Impact 4)** Should "AST" (Abstract Syntax Tree) be added to the Constitution glossary as a project-wide canonical term, given its fundamental role in MDX compilation across specs 003 and 007?

2. **(Impact 3)** What is the canonical distinction between "panel" (used in 007) and "pane" (used in 003, 006)? Should this be documented in the Constitution?

3. **(Impact 3)** The spec references "preview AST" and "useErrorNavigation hook" - should these be formally defined in the glossary with their owning spec referenced?

4. **(Impact 3)** Should "Source Position" (line/column tuple) be elevated to the Constitution glossary to ensure consistent usage across specs?

5. **(Impact 2)** Should the feature name be standardized to just "MDX Content Outline" (dropping "Navigator") to avoid synonym confusion?
