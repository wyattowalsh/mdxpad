# Specification Quality Checklist: Keyboard Shortcuts & Command Palette

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items pass validation
- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- The spec includes 41 functional requirements covering command registry, palette UI, shortcuts, and integrations
- 8 measurable success criteria defined
- 6 user stories with clear priorities (P1-P3)
- Edge cases documented for input field handling, modifier keys, failures, multi-window, and context-sensitive shortcuts
